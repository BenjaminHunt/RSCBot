# RSCBot: combineRooms

The `combineRooms` cog is primarily responsible for managing combines for RSC. This involves dynamically creating and deleting voice channels under a "Combine Rooms" category. This cog uses discord events to keep rooms open for each tier that has been established.

## Installation

The `combineRooms` cog depends on the `teamManager` cog. Install `teamManager` as well as its dependencies before installing `combineRooms`.

```
<p>cog install RSCBot combineRooms
<p>load combineRooms
```

## Usage

- `<p>combines`
  Its that simple! This command behaves as a switch. If a combines category exists, it will run a teardown of all the rooms. If there is not a combines category established, it will create one, and add a voice channel for each tier.

- `<p>combines [keywords]`
  The `keywords` parameter can be used to force the start/stop behavior with the following keywords:
- Start combines keywords: start, create
- Stop combines keywords: stop, teardown, end

## Customization

- `<p>setPlayersPerRoom` (Default: 6)
  - Sets the reccomended concurrent FA/DE limit in a room.
  - (Disabled) The room name will reflect the number of FA/DE players in them
    - Naming format: `<Rank> room <room number> (<player count>/<players_per_room>)`
  - Examples:
    - 3v3 leagues should have no more than 6 Free Agent/Draft Eligible players combined.
    - 2v2 leagues should have no more than 4 Free Agent/Draft Eligible players combined.
    - Special case: RSC's 1v1 league will have rooms of 4 players, who will cycle through matches against each other player in the room.
- `<p>setRoomCapacity` (Default: 10)
  - Sets the limit for discord members in room. This limit is role agnostic.
  - This is a limit for players and scouts in a single room.
- `<p>togglePublicity` (Default: Public)
  - Toggles the combines between a Public and Private status.
  - If combines are Public, any member may participate.
  - If combines are Private, only members with the "League" role may particpate.
- `<p>setAcronym` (Default: RSC)
  - Sets the acronym used in the combines cog.
  - This is used to tweak the default message in the #combine-details channel, such as rule reference, and room information.
